datacollector
=============
The goal for this project is to be able to collect all kinds of useful financial data which isn't easily
available in bulk for free as well as data that is available. Ideally it will allow you to provide a list
of stock tickers/CIKs and grab historical price information as well as information from financial statements
such as balance sheet/income statement/cash flows specifics and give it to you in an form that would allow
input into a database where it can be easily queried.

Building

datacollector is managed using gradle and can be built using gradle.
